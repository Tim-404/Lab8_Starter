1) I would fit the tests in a Github action that runs whenever code is pushed. This ensures that it is run frequently, allowing me to catch bugs sooner rather than later. It also doesn't require the developers to be disciplined to run the tests locally.
2) No. That's for unit tests.
3) No. Writing and sending a message would probably be split into multiple functions, in which case and e2e test would be more fitting.
4) Yes. This feature can be implemented easily inside a single function, so a unit test is appropriate.
